    "text": "3 Instructions\n\n3.1 Setup and Inspection\nCreate a new Quarto document for your lab report. Load the tidyverse package and read in the two CSV files using read_csv().\nInspect the anxiety_wide object. Note that it is currently in wide format: there is one row per patient, but the anxiety scores are spread across multiple columns (anxiety_wk1, anxiety_wk2, etc.). This format is unsuitable for MLM and must be reshaped.\n\n\n3.2 Reshape (Pivot)\nCreate a new object called anxiety_long. Use the pivot_longer() function to transform the wide anxiety data into long format.\n\nCols: Select the columns that start with the string “anxiety”.\nNames: Send the old column names to a new column called \"week\".\nValues: Send the scores to a new column called \"anxiety\".\n\n\n\n3.3 Clean the Data\nLook at your new week column. It currently contains character strings (e.g., \"anxiety_wk1\").\nOverwrite the week column using mutate() and parse_number() to convert these strings into clean numbers (e.g., 1).\n\n\n3.4 Cluster-Level Summaries\nWe want to determine the minimum (best) anxiety score each patient reached during the study.\nUse mutate() to add this as a new column called min_score to your long dataset. You must use the .by argument (or group_by()) to ensure this calculation happens per patient (patient_id).\n(Hint: You can use the min() function to find the lowest score).\n\n\n3.5 Merging Level 2 Data\nThe file patient_info.csv contains the study condition (Control vs. Treatment) for each person. This is Level 2 data.\nUse left_join() to merge this demographic info into your anxiety_long dataset. Join the two tables by the patient_id column.\nVerification: View your data to ensure the condition variable now appears for every time point (row) for each patient.\n\n\n3.6 Visualization\nUse ggplot() to create a “spaghetti plot” of the study results:\n\nMap week to the x-axis and anxiety to the y-axis.\nConnect the data points with lines (geom_line()).\nGroup the lines by patient_id so we see individual trajectories.\nColor the lines by condition.\n\nInterpretation Question: Based on your plot, does the Treatment group seem to improve (i.e., scores go down) faster than the Control group?"

    "text": "Course Description\nStatistical methods for analyzing multilevel data (e.g., datasets with clustered, nested, or longitudinal structures) using a framework known variously as multilevel, mixed-effects, hierarchical linear, or random-coefficient modeling. The course reviews ordinary least squares regression and then introduces: the challenges posed by multilevel data, tools for processing multilevel data for analyses, and both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimation. Core topics include partial pooling, random intercepts, fixed and random slopes, cross-level interactions, model comparison, troubleshooting, applications to repeated-measures and longitudinal data, and thorough diagnostics and reporting. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding paired with hands-on analysis in statistical software. Students apply methods to real datasets and complete an independent project.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nExplain the issues that clustered data cause for the linear model\nContrast the pros and cons of different approaches for clustered data\nPrepare a clustered dataset for multilevel analysis in R\nEstimate various types of multilevel models in R\nFlexibly specify different random effects structures\nInterpret the fixed and random effects estimates\nExplain the rationale and consequences of partial pooling\nIdentify the interpretation implied by each centering option\nDetail and assess the assumptions made by a multilevel model\nDecompose repeated and longitudinal measures into components\nDiscuss the idea of Bayesian estimation for multilevel models\nDiscuss the ideas of nested and cross-classified models\n\n\n\nInstructor\n\nDr. Jeffrey Girard (jmgirard at ku dot edu), Instructor\nDasha Yermol (dayermol at ku dot edu), Teaching Assistant\n\n\n\nClass Time and Location\n\nM 11:00AM - 12:15PM in Wescoe 4035\nF 02:00PM - 03:45PM in Wescoe 4035\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nT 11:00AM - 12:00PM (Dasha, FR 528)\nT 03:00PM - 04:00PM (Jeff, FR 454)\nR 10:00AM - 11:00AM (Dasha, FR 528)\nF 12:00PM - 01:00PM (Jeff, FR 454, odd weeks)\nF 01:00PM - 02:00PM (Jeff, FR 454, even weeks)"
