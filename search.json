    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistical methods for analyzing multilevel data (e.g., datasets with clustered, nested, or longitudinal structures) using a framework known variously as multilevel, mixed-effects, hierarchical linear, or random-coefficient modeling. The course reviews ordinary least squares regression and then introduces: the challenges posed by multilevel data, tools for processing multilevel data for analyses, and both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimation. Core topics include partial pooling, random intercepts, fixed and random slopes, cross-level interactions, model comparison, troubleshooting, applications to repeated-measures and longitudinal data, and thorough diagnostics and reporting. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding paired with hands-on analysis in statistical software (e.g., R). Students apply methods to real datasets and complete an independent project.\n\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nExplain the issues that clustered data cause for the linear model\nContrast the pros and cons of different approaches for clustered data\nPrepare a clustered dataset for multilevel analysis in R\nEstimate various types of multilevel models in R\nFlexibly specify different random effects structures\nInterpret the fixed and random effects estimates\nExplain the rationale and consequences of partial pooling\nIdentify the interpretation implied by each centering option\nDetail and assess the assumptions made by a multilevel model\nDecompose repeated and longitudinal measures into components\nDiscuss the idea of Bayesian estimation for multilevel models\nDiscuss the ideas of nested and cross-classified models\n\n\n\nInstructor\n\nDr. Jeffrey Girard (jmgirard at ku dot edu), Instructor\nDasha Yermol (dayermol at ku dot edu), Teaching Assistant\n\n\n\nClass Time and Location\n\nM 11:00AM - 12:15PM in Wescoe 4035\nF 02:00PM - 03:45PM in Wescoe 4035"
