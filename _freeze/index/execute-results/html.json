The course reviews ordinary least squares regression and then introduces: the challenges posed by multilevel data, tools for processing multilevel data for analyses, and both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimation. Core topics include partial pooling, random intercepts, fixed and random slopes, cross-level interactions, model comparison, troubleshooting, applications to repeated-measures and longitudinal data, and thorough diagnostics and reporting. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding paired with hands-on analysis in statistical software. Students apply methods to real datasets and complete an independent project.\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\n\n- Explain the issues that clustered data cause for the linear model\n- Contrast the pros and cons of different approaches for clustered data\n- Prepare a clustered dataset for multilevel analysis in R\n- Estimate various types of multilevel models in R\n- Flexibly specify different random effects structures\n- Interpret the fixed and random effects estimates\n- Explain the rationale and consequences of partial pooling\n- Identify the interpretation implied by each centering option\n- Detail and assess the assumptions made by a multilevel model\n- Decompose repeated and longitudinal measures into components\n- Discuss the idea of Bayesian estimation for multilevel models\n- Discuss the ideas of nested and cross-classified models\n\n### Instructor\n\n- [Dr. Jeffrey Girard](mailto:jmgirard@ku.edu), Instructor\n- [Dasha Yermol](mailto:dayermol@ku.edu), Teaching Assistant\n\n### Class Time and Location\n\n- M 11:00AM - 12:15PM in Wescoe 4035\n- F 02:00PM - 03:45PM in Wescoe 4035\n\n### Office Hours\n\n- T 11:00AM - 12:00PM (Dasha, FR 528)\n- T 03:00PM - 04:00PM (Jeff, FR 454)\n- R 10:00AM - 11:00AM (Dasha, FR 528)\n- F 12:00PM - 01:00PM (Jeff, FR 454, odd weeks)\n- F 01:00PM - 02:00PM (Jeff, FR 454, even weeks)\n\n",
